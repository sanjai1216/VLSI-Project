# 🔥 8-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an 8-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL and verifies its functionality using a custom testbench in Xilinx Vivado.

The ALU is a fundamental component of digital processors, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations based on a control signal (`sel`).

This project was developed as part of my VLSI Design & Verification learning journey.

## 🚀 Features

The ALU supports the following operations:

| Select (sel) | Operation |
|-------------|-----------|
| 000 | Addition (A + B) |
| 001 | Subtraction (A - B) |
| 010 | Bitwise AND |
| 011 | Bitwise OR |
| 100 | Bitwise XOR |
| 101 | Bitwise NOT (~A) |
| 110 | Left Shift (A << 1) |
| 111 | Right Shift (A >> 1) |

## 🧪 Verification

### Test Inputs

```text
A = 20
B = 10
```

### Simulation Results

| Operation | Result |
|------------|---------|
| 20 + 10 | 30 |
| 20 - 10 | 10 |
| 20 AND 10 | 0 |
| 20 OR 10 | 30 |
| 20 XOR 10 | 30 |
| NOT 20 | 235 |
| 20 << 1 | 40 |
| 20 >> 1 | 10 |

All operations were successfully verified through behavioral simulation.
